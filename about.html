    At Priory, we have created a revolutionary new system that brings technology to extracurriculars like never before.
    Our collaborative forum allows students from different clubs to share excess funds, making resource allocation much more efficient, publicly post opportunities for competetions and club events, and even makes inter-club collaboration possible. While there is faculty oversight, to prevent misuse, everything is run by students. This provides real-world experience in leadership, as well as in working together with other organizations.
